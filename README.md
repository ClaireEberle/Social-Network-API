# Social-Network-API



## Description
    
This project was created using JavaScript and mongoDB to create API routes for managing an online social network platform. These routes allow for a user to create an account and sign in, add friends, post thoughts, and add reactions to thoughts that have been posted. Routes allow for editing and deleting thoughts, users, reactions and friends.
